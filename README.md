# Coding Quiz Java Application

This is a fully featured web application built with Javascript that quizzes the user on Javascript-centered coding knowledge. The application has dynamic content that is animated with CSS and is responsive to any screen size or device. The application includes a timed multiple choice quiz with penalties for errors. Upon completion, the players score and initials are added to a highscore table. This table updates upon each completion, and the data is saved to local storage to be loaded during future sessions.
